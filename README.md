Boggle game and solver (HTML/Javascript)

One day when I was planning to have a game of Boggle and didn't have a copy of
a physical board to hand, I thought it would be good to have a pure
HTML+Javascript version of the game that could be played on any computer.
Thus jsboggle was born. Fortunately, I'd already, at some point in the distant
past, written a boggle board generator and solver in C++ so it was just a
matter of rewriting it for JavaScript (surprisingly easy, although involved a
bit of looking stuff up as I didn't know the language very well).
